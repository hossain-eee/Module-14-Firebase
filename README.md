By using StreamBuilder () widget, when data change inside firebase no need to hot-reload it will automatically update data in emulator, that mean live stremaing. Similar for data change by FAB button, no need to re-load. StramBuilder widget 1st and 2nd widget but third widget is use FutureBuilder(), no need to do that, just kepp it if want to see difference between StreaBuilder() and FutureBuilder() code
